<h1>Biography</h1>
<img src="thc.jpg" alt="THC" /></p>
<p>My name is Kamden Segawa. I'm currently a junior at Tufts University majoring in 
Quantitative Economics and minoring in Computer Science. I'm the VP of the Tufts Hawaii 
Club, an organization that aims to educate the Tufts community on issues relating to the 
state of Hawaii and its people. </p>
<p>Because I was born and raised in Hawaii, I enjoy the chilling at the beach, eating spam 
and 75 degree days in January. Because Hawaii doesn't have any professional teams, I'm a huge 
fan of Bay Area teams such as the Giants, 49ers, and to a lesser degree the Warriors. 
Barry Bonds is the greatest baseball player I've ever seen and Michael Crabtree was 
interfered with on the 4th down play that decided Super Bowl 47. Yeah, I'm still bitter.
